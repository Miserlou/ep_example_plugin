##An Etherpad Lite Example Plugin

### By Rich Jones
### (but really by John McLear)

This project shows three important things one may wish to do while creating a plugin: 

* Editing the "chrome", rendered on the server side. This makes the buttons look red for no reason.
* Manipulating the actual contents of a pad based on the line content. This adds basic images support, pinched from ep_previewimages.

## Installation

Copy to highest level node_modules directory (same folder as ep_etherpad-lite)

## TODO

* Tutorial
* Publishing guide?
