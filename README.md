##An Etherpad Lite Example Plugin

### By Rich Jones
### (but really by John McLear)

This project shows three important things one may wish to do while creating a plugin: 

* Editing the "chrome", rendered on the server side
* Using client-side hooks to change client-side code execution
* Manipulating the actual contents of a pad based on the line content.
